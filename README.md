# FORTH Interpreters

I've always wanted to build a FORTH implementation from scratch, and now 
I'm finally getting around to it! This repository will be home to my FORTH 
interpreters for different computers I'm building, beginning with an 
implementation for a 65C02 8-bit computer. I'll be posting about progress on this project at [https://www.ahl27.com/blog/](https://www.ahl27.com/blog/)!

If I'm not totally done with FORTH by the end of this project, I'll look into porting it to the 65C816 family of microprocessors.

I'm not planning to stick to the ANSI standard FORTH, though once I have a working build I'll consider looking at how much effort it would take to ANSIfy it. Rumor on the street is FORTH works best on 16-bit systems, so I may save that challenge for the 65C816 build I have tentatively planned.
