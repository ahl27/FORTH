# FORTH Interpreters

I've always wanted to build a FORTH implementation from scratch, and now 
I'm finally getting around to it! This repository will be home to my FORTH 
interpreters for different computers I'm building, beginning with an 
implementation for a 65C02 8-bit computer.

If I'm not totally done with FORTH by the end of this project, I'll look into porting it to the 65C816 family of microprocessors.
